move. don't die. 

swing your hair because you've got better hair than zenn.

smile because you look ugly if you don't

live because others can't

haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate

Go out there, create havoc, stun the world

Appreciate those around you. You never know when they will leave.

Humans always look for things that they don't have.

In the moment when you truly understand your enemy, understand them well 
enough to defeat them, then in that very moment you also love them.
Itâ€™s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, 
what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves.
~ Ender's Game
